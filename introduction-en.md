**Blobnom** introduces a game like layer to the challenging yet rewarding world of competitive programming. 

We understand that consistent practice, especially on platforms like [Baekjoon Online Judge](https://boj.kr) (BOJ), [Codeforces](https://codeforces.com/problemset) (CF) Archive can sometimes become monotonous. **Blobnom** aims to reignite the fun and competitive spirit by allowing users to "claim" algorithm problems as territories on a shared map.

 Solve problems, expand your domain, and compete with others in a persistent, visualized environment.

## Core Concept: Territorial Conquest

Imagine the vast collection of BOJ problems represented as hexagonal tiles on a world map. Blobnom brings this vision to life:

1.  **Start:** Join or create a Blobnom room and begin playing solo or with friends.

2.  **Solve:** Be the first user to successfully solve a specific problem, and the corresponding hexagonal tile on the Blobnom map becomes your territory!

3.  **Compete:** See the map updates in real time as users claim territories. Compete with friends and the community to build the largest empire and climb the leaderboards. Blobnom will give you realtime alerts.
